# Small Project #4 - Blackjack

### Description
Oh god, the debugging.<br><br>
Blackjack, or twenty-one, is a popular casino card game played between the player and the house, usually represented as 
a dealer. The goal of the game is for each player to get as close as possible to the number 21 with playing cards 
without going over. If either player goes over, then they "bust" or loose the hand and any money that they put up. 
Additional information on the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).
