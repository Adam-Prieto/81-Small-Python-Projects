# Small Project #3 Bitmap Message

### Description
I did not like this project. 

Very briefly, this project has the user input a message and uses that input to alter a predefined "picture" or bitmap 
that is then output to the console. The reason why I disliked this project so much, is because the user needs to spend
time creating a new bitmap image and then only does string manipulation on said image. Not very exciting or productive.
