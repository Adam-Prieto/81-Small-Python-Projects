# Small Project #1 - Bagels

### Description
This project implements a kind of "number check and guess" game where the user tries to guess a random 'n' digit 
number when given certain clues. Taken straight from the console itself:

> I am thinking of an 'n' digit number with no repeated digits.  
> Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:  
> 
> - **Pico**: One digit is correct but in the wrong position.  
> - **Fermi**: One digit is correct and in the right position.  
> - **Bagels**: No digit is correct.

### Background
Although this project is not of my own creation, I did try to understand what's going on as well as implement
the game again from scratch without (or rather with as little) use of the answer key. The idea being that I should try 
and implement the game again by memory, or from just playing the game.
