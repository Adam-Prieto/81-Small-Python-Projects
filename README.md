# Small Project #2 - Birthday Paradox

### Description
We all have a birthday -- it's the day we entered the world, and it's usually celebrated by enjoying cake, ice cream, 
and other festivities. We also know that there are plenty of other people in the world who share our own birthday. 
However, what many don't realize is that, in a surprisingly small group, there's an "unusually" high probability that
at least two people will share the same birthday. In fact, as this project can prove, it only takes a group size of 23 
individuals before it becomes more likely that at least two people will share a birthday. Surprising indeed.

This project mathematically proves this hypothesis by first generating a test group (using user
input), generates random birthdays for those people, and checks for duplicates. Then, with one iteration of this 
experiment completed, the program runs the same trial again -- 100,000 times over. 

Monte Carlo experimentation aside, this project also introduces date times in python, working with these objects, as 
well as running the same experiment a hundred thousand times.
